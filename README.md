# testing-practice
This repository contains a set of JavaScript functions along with corresponding Jest test cases to practice unit testing. The project includes:

- A `capitalize` function to capitalize the first letter of a string.

- A `reverseString` function to return a reversed string.

- A `calculator` object with add, subtract, divide, and multiply methods.

- A `caesarCipher` function that shifts characters while preserving case and punctuation.

- An `analyzeArray` function that returns the average, min, max, and length of a given array.

This project follows Jest's testing methodology. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in writing tests and ensuring code reliability.
